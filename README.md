In this project, we are trying to compare number of C/C++/Java files(content wise) and show similarity precent between them. Documentation Distance alogrithm(quite inefficent) is used to compare the contents of the files
This is my first project so I wont recommend anyone go through the code(its a mesh). If you still want to make any contribution you are welcome.
This project in written entirely in Java. Front-End is designed using JavaFx. Designing is done using css and JavaFx inbuilt function.
Main class-<strong> codecomparer.java</strong> -> It is main class of the project. It also include code for login feature
</br>
Signup Java file -> signup feature
</br>
str java file -> It contains the algorithm used(It is no acutally implemented in the project. It was for testing purpose)
</br>
menu file-> Most of the work in done here. It has a code for the screen that will appear after login. Algorithm is acutally implemented here.
</br>
Login and signup use Mysql database.
</br>
your have to change it to your mysql login info
</br>
<strong>YOU CAN ALSO RUN THE APPLICATON FROM JAR FILE</strong>
